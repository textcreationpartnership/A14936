            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader the two Treatiſes enſuing were written by M. WENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTH, whoſe zealous affection to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, his Prince &amp; countrie, hath bene made better known to al her Maieſties good ſubjects, by his patient and conſtant indurance for ſo good a cauſe as he maintained, then it can be by any mans reporte or commendation. In the former (which by the adviſe of ſome friends he preferred to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in forme of a ſupplication) is prooved, that for the ſafetie of the kingdomes of England and Scotland, and of the Religion profeſſed in them, it is abſolutelie neceſſarie that al the claimes and titles to the crowne of this Realme be tried by Parliament, and that the rightfull ſucceſſour to her highneſſe be declared and confirmed nowe in her Maieſties life-time. I doubt not but every re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligious and true hearted ſubiect is of his minde. The latter declaring his opinion concerning the perſon of the true &amp; lawfull ſucceſſor, he ſent to ſome privie friends at their inſtant requeſt: it may ſeeme ſtrange that hee woulde venture to write it, in reſpect of theſe tickliſh times, and of his preſent troubles for a leſſer matter: but yet there was ſtrong reaſons leading him to doe the ſame. I haue publiſhed them both not ſo much to procure commendation &amp; praiſe to the dead, though he iuſtlie deſerue it for his moſt worthie
<pb facs="tcp:20381:3"/> parts, as to worke a due regarde of right and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, to the good and behoofe of all my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen: and that he whoſe mouth was ſtopped from ſpeaking the good which he would when he did liue, might now without danger openlie proclaime the ſame, (though ſome would not) after his death. And as he was accuſtomed to ſay to his friends, if it bee a duetie required of vs to communicate our knowledge in the meaneſt matters for mutuall inſtruction: who in any good conſcience can ſuppreſſe his knowledge in matters ſo greatly importing every private and publick eſtate of theſe Realmes? yea both earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie kingdomes and the kingdome of Chriſt. For theſe reſpects I haue thought it expedient, that hee who hath ſpoken in the Parliament with ſo great regarde and good liking of all the hearers, ſhoulde nowe as it were with his owne mouth ſpeak to all the ſubjects of England, ſeing it is a matter that ſo greatly concerneth vs all. I haue altered or ſuppreſſed no thing in either of them, vnles it be titles and names of perſons, &amp; places, &amp; words of courteſie, which were not at al requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſite to be knowne. Some things I haue quoted in the margent for thy better vnderſtanding, being acquainted with his meaning, and haue alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhed ſome things for the help of the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now for my ſelf (good Reader) I ſpeak my opinion in the trueth of my conſcience, that the Scottiſh King (for anything I knowe) hath the beſt right to ſucceede to our gracious and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie. Wherein I am the more confirmed for that I know it to be the opinion of ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who make as much conſcience of their doings,
<pb facs="tcp:20381:3"/> and haue as much wiſdome &amp; law in their bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, as any man whatſoever that is in this land. And to mee it ſeemeth a thing altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, yea voide of common ſenſe and reaſon, to fetch with ſo great adoe the branches and pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from William the Conqueror, Edward the firſt, or Edward the third, and to contend and to diſpute a freſh for the houſes of Lancaſter and Yorke, ſeeing all good men confeſſe, that the right muſt haue beene in the children of Henrie the ſeaventh, and Elizabeth eldeſt daughter to Edward the fourth. And if by all our judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the two titles were in them moſt happily joined he muſt be vnhappie, that would ſeek to diſſolue them. We haue paide too deare for pleading bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken titles: and other ſervice will pleaſe God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to purge this land with our bloode for our vnthankfulneſſe of all the benefites which wee doe at this preſent enjoy. But to goe a little further, if her Maieſtie had a daughter or ſiſter, I dare be bolde to avouche that none in all Engl. durſt preſume to ſpeak againſt her: yet ſhe could not poſſibly haue any better rightor title, I ſpeak of the ground of it, then the heires of the Lady Margaret Teuther may claime by her. For if the right of the brother King Henrie the 8. and his children be good, the right of his eldeſt ſiſter La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Margaret and her heires cannot be badde, &amp; for want of his iſſue, hers muſt needes come in. The acts and ſtatutes wreſted againſt the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh king, are, in my conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by diverſe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie anſwered. The inconveniences pretended for barring him, are but ſuſpitions and ſurmiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged without any colourable ground, and
<pb facs="tcp:20381:4"/> though they were true, yet they were rather to be admitted, then the manifeſt ruine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alms. Finally, I wiſh thee ſo to read theſe treatiſes of M. Wentworths, as hee was accuſtomed to read other mens, to wit, to yeeld tot he reaſon, and not to the man, for if he or I be deceived, it is enough that wee beare the blame of our owne error, though wee bee not alſo burdened with thine, and therefore do as thou will anſwere for it, for I ſeek thy good, and not to hurt thee. Thus proteſting that with my hart I deſire hereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the preſervation and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion, the ſtanding of my natiue Prince and countrie, and that if I did knowe a better right then the Scottiſh kings, I would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedlie favour it, I leaue thee for this matter to the gracious direction of the Almighty.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20381:10"/> congregation of the Lord, bee not as ſheepe without a ſheep-heard. And that it may appeare how well this care of his (to make his ſucceſſor knowne before he died) was liked &amp; approued of the Lord, it followeth immediatlie in the ſame place, that the Lord gaue him direction<note place="margin">Numb. 27. 18.</note> to appoint Ioſhuah, the ſonne of Nun, to be the man. According to which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, it is recorded alſo in another place, that Moſes moſt willingly &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie did ordaine him to ſucceed him. By this preſident &amp; good example, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than<note place="margin">Numb. 27. 22. 23. Deut. 31. 5.</note> had a good warrant to moue Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhebah (as the fitteſt perſon to make the motion) to go vnto king Dauid, and to put him in remembrance of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequent of not notifying in his life-time, who ſhould ſucceed him. Who beeing therevpon mooued by her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare who it ſhould be, as it appeareth in the ſtorie, moſt readilie and ſpeedilie, in moſt ſolemne manner, cauſed Salomons<note place="margin">1. King. 1. from the 11. verſe vnto the 41. verſe.</note> title to be publiſhed to be the right, and the next. And ſo danger was preuented,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20381:11"/> though Adoniiah was then vp in armes for it: &amp; olde Dauid went vnto his graue in peace, and the kingdome was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to Salomon his ſonne, and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably it flouriſhed in his time. There was likelie then to haue bene great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the title of ſucceſſion amongſt the ſonnes that Dauid had by diuers wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: and ſo great perill to the kingdome<note place="margin">The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Iſraell and England.</note> and ſubiects of Dauid. The conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof made Dauid carefull to end the controuerſie in his life-time. But now amongſt vs, the contention for the crowne, when God hath once taken you hence (if by like meanes by you it be not preuented) is like to bee amongſt the children of diuerſe families, and therfore the more deadlie: and conſequentlie the more dangerous. Wherefore as the ſtate of Iſraell then mooued Dauid to make his ſucceſſor knowne: ſo nowe the ſtate of England ought to moue you: for herein, he did but that which Moſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample taught him to doe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, which as a king he was bound
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20381:11"/> to doe. Againe it is euident in the ſtory that the Lord did lyke and allowe of his ſo doing, and therefore there was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience therein to the Lordes will: for mans owne will-works, he neuer deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in. An example then it is to follow in the like caſe to all good Kings and Queenes: and as a mirrour, it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſtill to all ſuch to teache them to doe the like, when like neede requyreth. For whatſoeuer is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Application of the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to her Maieſtie. Rom. 15. 4.</note> is written for our learning. Think therefore (moſte gratious ſoueraigne) that theſe facts of Moſes and Dauid are thus recorded in the holieſtoric, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that you ſhould knowe that God his Magiſtrates thus gouerned: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie, that hereby you may learne to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne to the ſafetie of your ſubiectes, as they did. Thus you ſee, that neither pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill to their perſons, nor feare of Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their owne preſent honors could ſtay either of theſe from gouerning to the ſafetie of their people: and yet they had ſufficient wiſdome to foreſee what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20381:12"/> might befall them that way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it were vertue and obedience to God in them: and ſo, no worke of ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, as ſufficientlie it hath alreadie appeared: how can it be but a falt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his holy will in your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, if (vppon ſo vrgent and iuſt occaſion as they or euer any Prince had) you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to doe as they did?</p>
                     <p>Further we reade that when Eſay the Prophet brought Hezekiah word that he ſhould ſet his houſe in order, for that hee ſhould die: that the king wept ſore: of<note place="margin">Eſay. 38. 1. 2. The fift argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the example of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah, who wept when he heard that he ſhould die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus then there was no heire apparant to ſucceed him.</note> which his weeping, S. Auguſtine vppon Eſay affirmeth this to bee the principall cauſe, that if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had died, he had died without an heyre apparant. And very well may it be ſo, for if it had ſo falne out to his griefe he foreſawe, that not onely great calamities and troubles therevpon would haue enſued to his people, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that it was ſome teſtimonie of the Lords wrath towards him, if in him God ſhould haue ceaſed from performing his promiſe to Dauid, of neuer leauing him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20381:12"/> without one to ſit on his throne after him: which cauſed him rather to weepe, then the newes of his death, ſaieth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine. And to vſe a good proofe for the truth heereof, this is certaine, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes his heire that ſucceeded him, was not either borne or begotten when he ſo wept. For it is ſaid that he was but twelue yeares old when he began to raigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ezechiah vppon his repentance had 15. yeares added to his life, after thus he had wept.

To this we anſwere: firſt, that the<note place="margin">The obiection of the former difficultie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the right of the title is plaine and eaſie to the skilfull.</note> obſcuritie and difficulty of the title it ſelf by the wiſe and skilfull in the Lawes of this Realme, will as eaſilie bee removed, as the droſſe is ſevered from the gold, by the skilfull finers: or as the bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſunne doth cauſe the cloudes to vaniſh and flee away.

And therefore, the more care ought they to haue that ſtand at the helme.

And yet if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch impatiencie ſhould appeare, without anie great difficultie might it be ſtaied by you in your life time, from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out into anie dangerous effect. Whereas, if you ſhoulde depart from vs before the determining of this wofull queſtion: then, there woulde bee none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men to ſtay the furie thereof, but the bloodie and devouring ſword. Oh, moſt dolefull iudge. Allas, what can anie ambitious competitor be able to doe to

No, no, there will be none of them (if you take this courſe) but they will evidentlie ſee thereby, that you and your freends are grown ſo ſtrong, that for anie of them to burſt out of due order, were but even willinglie to bring vppon them-ſelves and their families, vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Adonijah was vp in armes for the crown, when his father David lay on his death bed: and hee had gotten Ioab, the mightieſt captaine of Iſraell, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar the high Prieſt on hisſide: and

Secondlie we ſay, ſuppoſe there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> were aſmuch perill vnto your perſon, as is pretended: yet the peril of your worthy Realme, beeing ſo great and palpable as it hath beene proved to be, through the want of the eſtabliſhment of a knowne ſucceſſor: it may not therefore be left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: for, never ſo evident a perill, (your wiſdome knoweth) freeth any from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that dutie, that the Lord enioyned them to doe: for obedience to his will is to be preferred before our owne honour<note place="margin">Confirmed by the example of Eſther.</note> and ſafetie. Alwaies Queene Heſter, the wife of Ahaſhueroſh king of 127. provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vnderſtanding into what extreame perill her countrie people the Iewes wer brought by the meanes of Haman, put her life and honour in evident perill, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinglie and willingly deſerving death by law, to prevent the danger towardes her naturall people. For to the hazard of her

Loe, heere, an heathen knowne ſucceſſor, not by nature, but by adoption (as it is cleere in the ſtorie) for al that which is obiected againſt a known ſucceſſor, hath not onlie not perilled, but preſerved the life of him that had made him his ſucceſſor.

Thirdlie, he is vertuouſlie and religiouſly to be brought vp (if he be vnder yeeres) and to haue about him alwaies ſome tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and faithfull freends and counſellors to the preſent Prince, to direct him in a good courſe, and to deſcrie him if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin but to treade awrie.

So that theſe examples rather proue, that there is perill to the preſent governor from ſecret, ambitious, and vnknowne competitors, than from known ſucceſſors: for three of theſe were neyther heyres nor ſucceſſors by right, to them whome they depoſed: and the fourth had the Crowne throwne in his lappe, both vnlooked and vnwiſhed for. And in deede and truth princes are in far more danger, ſucceſſion not beeing eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20381:45"/> then when it is ſetled. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is forcible, for the neglect thereof produceth the diſfavour of God, and his ſubiects: whereof we haue a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of David, who before he did eſtabliſh the ſucceſſion in Salomon, was in farre more danger then afterwards: for before, firſt Abſolon, then Adoniiah were vp in armes for the crown, but Salomon once ſetled in the title of ſucceſſion, we reade of no more ſuch dangerous attemptes in his time. And certaine it is that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie hath beene in much more danger hitherto (the title to ſucceed you beeing vndetermined) then you can be by anie likelyhoode, when ſoever it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared who hath the right of ſucceſſion. And ſo by this that is ſaid alreadie, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie appeareth, that the perilles by having a known ſucceſſor, are rather ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of perilles then perilles in deede: whereas by concealing of the ſucceſſion, and not declaring where it reſteth, your Maieſtie knoweth, a ſucceſſor how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſoever ſuppoſed, yet mightilie ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20381:45"/> both by domeſticall traitours and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne enemies, hath bred you manie evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and dangerous perilles. The Lord be bleſſed, who hath delivered you out of their ſnares &amp; pits, and hath intrapped themſelues therin. But you haue no cauſe yet to thinke (moſte gratious Ladie) but that the popiſh faction, which other mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, having nowe loſt the ſtaffe of their hope, but that they ere this haue<note place="margin">The Queene of Scots.</note> buſied themſelues to finde another: for you may aſſure your ſelfe, the more ſilent you are to make knowne your ſucceſſor, the glader are they: for they thinke they may thereby the more boldlie ſet vp one to themſelues in their owne conceites: wherein, when their deviſes and plots are come to anie ripeneſſe, former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath taught you what to looke for from them, or at their hands. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue you alwaies from them and their treacheries, and giue you grace ever to beware of them, and never to truſt them. Againe, what daunger is there that you can ſuppoſe to be likelie to ariſe by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20381:46"/> known your ſucceſſor, that evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ariſeth not of keeping him vnknown: for it is to bee thought, that where the beſt right is, it is well knowne to him that hath it. Then the more the right of his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle be ſought to bee ſuppreſſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, the more (it is likelie) it will ſtirre the coales of wrath in his heart, and the ſooner it will cauſe him to put forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, leaſt he ſhould (by ſilence) miſſe of that which he accounted his right. And will not the concealing therof cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to flatter themſelues that they haue a title: and ſo danger may ſpring vnto your Maieſtie from manie fountaines, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome perhaps that are not thought of. And all reaſon perſwadeth, that there is leſſe daunger to be feared from him that hath right to ſucceede eſpeciallie being bound vnto your maieſtie for publiſhing and manifeſting of his right, then by one that is grieved &amp; offended with your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, for hiding and ſuffering his title to lie hid. And every one ſeeth that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that ariſeth from one, &amp; him known,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20381:46"/> is eaſilier prevented, then that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from manie, &amp; ſome of them alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. It were queſtionleſſe therefore (everie way) the ſafeſt way for your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, to binde him that hath the beſt right to ſucceed to you, to all loue and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes towards you: and conſequently (by that kinde meanes) from ſeeking to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger you anie way: but eſpeciallie by your kind cleering &amp; declaring his right: and then alſo, to put out of hope all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that now wrongfully imagine they haue right there-vnto: whoſe ambition may ſtirre them vp to ſeeke the diademe. This (as I haue plainelie prooved) is the way that beſt pleaſeth God, &amp; that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt with the diſcharge of your dutie, both to him &amp; to your people: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be, but that it is farre more ſafe for your noble perſon ſo to doe, then otherwiſe: becauſe as al ſtories &amp; experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teache, it is alwaies the ſafeſt way, both for Prince &amp; ſubiect, to pleaſe God: and verie dangerous to thinke that there is more ſafety in following our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20381:47"/> and phantaſies, then his will and pleaſure. Saule (you know) was threatned for that he had broken Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to haue his kingdome rent from him, and it was ſo. And the rather may you ſee, that there is no reaſon in reſpect of perill to your perſon, to ſtay you from thus doing: becauſe (not onelie) it hath beene made to appeare manifeſtlie vnto you, that they are rather phanſied perils, then perils in deede. And now laſtlie, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon hath ſhewed you, that what ſoever thoſe perils be, yet the ſame, and rather greater, are more iuſtlie to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the not ſetling of the ſucceſſion. Wherefore we conclude, that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the former obiections) there is no ſufficient cauſe why you ſhould not make your ſucceſſor knowne, in reſpecte of anie perill to your perſon: ſeeing wee haue rather proved it much more ſafer, then perillous for your highnes ſo to do.</p>

As for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to proue it perillous to your honour, in that as men are given rather to honor the Sunne ryſing, then the ſetting therof: ſo, it is thought in this caſe, that they are given to preferre their newe Maiſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their olde Miſtreſſe: but theſe be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſmal moment: for the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that doe worſhip the Sunne, doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20381:48"/> fall flat on their faces, when it ſetteth as when it riſeth. And reaſon teacheth wiſe men rather to honor that ſunne, the ryſing whereof hath already much bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited them: then that which they cannot tell, whither it will benefite them in like meaſure, or no: Indeede, if the ſunne ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hath bene all the former day, but a glowming and vn-comfortable Sunne: then there is ſome reaſon, why the next daies Sunne ryſing (in hope that it wil be more comfortable and lightſome) ſhuld be rather honoured, then the other. But if the ſunne ſetting, hath beene all the day before, a cleere, lightſome, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſunne, all wiſe and honeſt men will bee ſo farre in loue with it, that they will be exceeding loath to parte with it, and will highlie honour it, ſetting: and alſo dolefullie mourne, when it is ſet.

And further you know, that though manie things bee moſte deſired, when they are new: yet manie are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt eſteemed, when they are olde. But what if ſome light perſons doe withdraw (then) ſome honour from you, and giue it to your ſucceſſor? what can that eclipſe your honour? when (by making your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor knowne) you are grown great and mightie (with a ſetled and vn-remouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue) in the heartes of all the graue, faithfull, and godlie wiſe men of the land.

The onelie good &amp; ſureſt meanes to alienate all their minds, from intending the murther of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties perſon (the which otherwiſe they will never ceaſe to practize) is, to ſettle the ſucceſſion of the crowne, ſucceſſiuelie to as manie, one after another, as the Lawe ſhal take notice of, to be inheritable ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For thereby they ſhall ſee, that they are never a white the nearer winning of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20381:50"/> the goale, though they ſhould take away your Maieſties life. For that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yet no civill warre or diſcorde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realme (the onelie cauſe of their greedie thirſting after your Maieſties blood) were like to enſue therof: for that your ſubiects wits and mindes would not thereby bee diſtracted, ſeeing they then ſhould know, and be certaine what head to leane and cleaue vnto: and woulde ſo be all vnited in one minde, to follow one, and the ſelfe ſame head. Manie therfore &amp; great are the benefits which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and the whole Realme ſhould reap by the preſent eſtabliſhment of ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for aſſoone as this were done, thoſe Engliſh traitours which are vſed by the ſtrangers, as wicked inſtruments, to ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your Maieſties daies, would preſently deſiſt from practizing of that vile enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, &amp; your Maieſties enemies will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſiſt from hyring and pricking anie forward therevnto: for that no civil warre (the onlie mark wherat they aime) would enſue thervpon.

For God forbid, that he ſhould not haue it willinglie yeelded vnto him, if it be his right: for god would accurſe this land for their iniurie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, if they ſhould wrongfullie detain it from him.</p>
                     <p>If he haue no right or title thereunto, would it not be a great benefite vnto him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to haue his expectation and opinion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and ſatisfied by large argumentes: yea, and iudged by Parliament, thereby to keep this Realme, &amp; his alſo, in peace, loue and quietneſſe, avoiding open hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: the which (by manie bloodie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes) would ſo weaken both the Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as they were like to become a praie to the enemie: and thereby alſo to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, entertaine, and continue that loue &amp; amitie which is now betweene both the Realmes, to both their preſervations here

                     <p>If the ſucceſſor were ſetled by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and the title of the crowne given from the Scottiſh king (lawfullie) to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: hee having the fore-knowledge of the Parliament, and of the intent of the calling thereof: and beeing required ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee preſent thereat, or to ſend his learned counſell thither, and allowed to haue and retaine Lawiers learned in our Engliſhe lawes, to pleade and defend his title: I ſay, if this true iuſtice be duelie &amp; vprightlie weighed in an equal ballance, and this kindnes offered vnto the Scottiſh King, what cauſe hath he to become our enemie: or (for revenge ſake) to let in, or aide the Spaniard to ſubvert our ſtate: &amp; conſequentlie to endanger his own. And all becauſe her Maieſtie ſhould (by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20381:62"/> lawfull, and the moſt peaceable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that could be poſſiblie deviſed) ſeeke and indevour to preſerue both the Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of England &amp; Scotland: Both which beeing faſt linked and chained together with the ſtrong and godlie linkes and chaines of true loue, and Religion, and with the ſure amitie thereof: God will ſo take their parts, and ſtrengthen them, that they ſhould not neede to feare the malice, and enemitie of anie Princes of the earth. And I doe perſwade my ſelfe, that the chriſtian Scottiſh king, and his chriſtian nobilitie, haue ſuch a naturall loue and care to the preſervation of their common-wealth, that if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with, they would yeeld willinglie to haue his title to the crowne, quyetlie, vprightlie and lawfullie iudged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Parliament: to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both the realmes. Sure I am, that both godlines and wiſdome woulde it ſhoulde be ſo: in reſpect of both their ſafeties.</p>
                     <p>I aſtlie, if it ſo fall out, that he will (of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>

For it will be (farre) an eaſier matter to recover his favour, beeing loſt, then to recover the ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overthrowne: And the ſtate is, and ought to be a Iewell of greateſt price, and of moſt account with vs, next vnto the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Sure I am, and in reaſon it cannot be avoided, but the time will come (and the wiſeſt knoweth not how ſoon) that if this title bee not quietlie determined and ſetled by authoritie of Parliament in her Maieſties life (the which God long leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then) that both the realmes of England and Scotland, will dolefullie rue it. For they both are like to become (through their vngodlie diſſenſion) prayes for a ſtrange people. O wofull, cruel &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table time, Let ſuch as ſit at the helme, &amp;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20381:63"/> rule the ſtearns of the ſhips of both theſe our common-wealths (with great care) haue dutiful regard vnto this weighty ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice in time, if there be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either loue naturall care to poſteritie, or pitie and compaſſion to avoide the ſhedding of ſo much innocent blood, by manie bloodie battailes, as may make rivers to runne. Let ſuch (eftſoones I ſay) as rule the ſtearns of both the common-wealthes of England &amp; Scotland, lovinglie &amp; kindlie conferre, conſult and prevent the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes of both Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes in both their countries, &amp; that ſpedily: for the holy Ghoſt ſaith, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 23.</note> is by the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the God of heaven, let it be done ſpeedilie for the hous of the God of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for why ſhould he be wroth with the king and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And I thinke it no preſumption to affirme, that princes and magiſtrates are ordained and commanded of God, to preſerue both Gods Church and Gods people (as the text ſaith) and that ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, even when they ſee them in vnavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable

And ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence that the wiſeſt knoweth not how ſoone: let wiſe magiſtrats and counſellors beware of that wofull counſellor, Had I wiſt: who ever cometh to late, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a repentant cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellor, remedileſſe.</p>
                     <p>My ſimple capacitie iudgeth it to be a fearefull &amp; preſumptuous ſinne, yea, and a tempting of God, in both Engliſh and Scottiſh magiſtrates, to hazard the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pearles of the imperiall crownes of both theſe noble realmes, vppon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine life of one, albeit never ſo much wiſhed &amp; deſired to be drawne on length by all true and faithfull Engliſh hearts: yet, not to be attained, for God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the certaine time, though it bee vncertaine and vnknowne to anie. And when that dolefull time ſhall once come, no earneſt wailing, wiſhing or ſighing can recover it againe. And ſo I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this ſimple labour to your honors wiſe &amp; graue iudgements, deeming, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20381:64"/> the preſervation or ruine of the realme of England in this caſe, will be the ſame vnto the realme of Scotland: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be carefullie conſidered of both.</p>
                     <p>And ſo to conclude, I may affirme (in my ſimple iudgement) that the ſetling of the ſucceſſor by Parliament, equity &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, will be an eſpeciall good meane to increaſe, and long to continue true &amp; faithfull loue and amitie betweene our Chriſtian Queene, her chriſtian nobility and commons: and the chriſtian Scottiſh king, his chriſtian nobilitie &amp; commons: albeit the imperiall crowne of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie realme, ſhoulde be given (after her highnes deceaſe) from the ſaid Scottiſh king: ſithence hee and his nobilitie may (hereby) plainelie and evidentlie ſee, that we kindlie deſire and imbrace his loue, and neither envie him nor his title: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (yet) his rule nor government: but deſire (onlie) that the right may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie and vprightlie examined, ſought our, &amp; given to him, to whom (of right) it duelie appertaineth: wherby God may

                     <p>If the Scottiſh king were conferred with in this matter of great importance, as much concerning his ſafetie and the ſafetie of his realme, as the ſafetie of our ſtate, and ſhoulde refuſe and denie this godlie and quiet triall offered in the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levinth queſtion: thereby perilling both theſe worthie Common-wealthes: it would wound all hearts.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I haue receaved your letters, by the which you craue my opinion for the drift of DOLMANS book, and further what I think for the perſon of the true ſuceſſor. Sir, my iudgement in my own conceit is but weak, and I would<note place="margin">The occaſion of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> bee loath to diue into ſuch queſtions as may encreaſe my affliction. But yet as conſcience doeth binde mee to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate my ſmall meaſure of knowledge v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon good reſpects with al thoſe that ſeek not to entrap me, (as the late L. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour did at the Counſell table) but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelves of the right, in a matter ſo highly importing them, that they may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20381:68"/> be able to diſcerne betweene errour and truth. So I am firſt to diſcharge this duty to you, and to thoſe your freinds whom you doe mention, by reaſon of manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great bonds. I pray you bee carefull how you impart it: the times are tickliſh, and the handling of this queſtion verie dangerous, although conſcience and ſound policie doe require that even they who forbid it, ſhould moſte of all others ſearche it out, and earneſtlie debate it: for as wee nowe finde in experience by this book, the moſt dangerous practiſe which the enemies and traitours to our ſtate could ever haue vſed for the vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſame, is by ſuch ſeditious and pernitious courſes, to overwhelme the light &amp; right of ſucceſſion, with ſo great darknes, as the iudgements not onlie of the multitude, but even of manie of the better ſort may be dazeled: and when the time of trial ſhal come, they may be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſuch a dump and amazement as they ſhall not diſcerne what to doe, or whom to follow. So the mercileſſe ſword
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20381:68"/> ſhall giue iudgement with them that may be ſtrongeſt, and our country which is now populous, wealthie, &amp; renowmed for valour, ſhal be by our owne hand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled, waſted, tread vnder foote, and made a by-word by the proud enemie. Al which might bee eaſilie prevented, if it would pleaſe God to moue our dread ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne to take to hart that humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition which in the conſcience of my bounden dutie to God, her Maieſtie, and my countrie, I did exhibite to her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and for which now I patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, thogh moſt guiltleſſe, not only in my own conceit, but even in the judgement of my Lorde Treſurer: who as hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the counſell table, had three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times peruſed my book, and found no thing but what he thought to be true and ſtood aſſured would at laſt come to paſſe. But as he then ſaid her Maieſty had determined, that that queſtion ſhould be ſuppreſſed ſo long as ever ſhee lived. Good Sir, God hath his owne work go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, which no man ſhall ſtay, whither
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20381:69"/> it be for our good (as I hope &amp; moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie wiſhe or otherwaies, and on his will I willinglie reſt, that hath appointed a time for everie purpoſe vnder heaven.</p>
                  <p>As for the booke, this is my opinion in few words. That no man can in reaſon expecte to gather grapes of thornes, or<note place="margin">The authors opinion of Dolmans book.</note> thinke anie good can be intended to our Queene and countrie by a Spaniſh har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted papiſt. His name doth forewarne you of his deceite, which cleerelie appeareth in everie part of his booke. His purpoſe is plaine to worke our diſſenſion, debate and deſtruction. The booke is no fuller of lynes then of lies, which are countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced moſt times with the credite of noble men, other whiles flooriſhed and glazed with ſentences and textes of Scripture, impudentlie diſſwading the tryall of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which everie favorer of our good doth wiſh: it giveth title to manie, who haue no reaſon to be touched with anie ſuch matter, and cloſlie impeaches the right and governement of our gracious Queene. It is wiſelie ſuppreſſed, not for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20381:69"/> that it carries anie other force or greater matter then groſſe forgeries and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lies: but becauſe our people are weak and ſimple in this queſtion, and may bee eaſilie ſeduced, beeing barred to looke into it: notwithſtanding they ſtand char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their dutie to God &amp; their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, to examine and ſearch out the ſame. I haue not a litle ſtoode with ſome of my friends, whither this queſtion was more to be regarded then the matter of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. And I thinke by ſuch practiſes, we haue ſufficient proofe, that this is the foundation and pillar, on which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme and Religion doeth reſt. It is to no purpoſe to anſwere him, for we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be without gainſayers, even againſt the cleereſt truthes, yet in this my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I will briefly touch in their owne places, ſome things which hee hath craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie foiſted in, applying himſelfe cloſlie and covertlie to the diſpoſitions of our nation, eſpecially of the common ſort, that hee may the more forceablie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the doubtfulnes of the right of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20381:70"/> and ſo diſtract vs in mindes, and turne our forces againſt our ſelues. As for anie thing els that is in the ſaid booke, I ſay with Salomon, that a foole is not to be anſwered in his fooliſhnes, when the anſwering may imply ſome eſtimation or conceite of that which of it ſelfe is iuſt nothinge, but yet by anſwering may be thought to be ſomething.</p>
                  <p>For my opinion of the right of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it were fitter it came after then went<note place="margin">The Authors opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true ſucceſſor which was the ſecond point that was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> before a Parliament, as I tolde my Lord Chancellor: for this matter doth rather require the mouth of all England, then of anie one man: yet without preiudice to anie ſecond perſon, I will tell you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie what I doe diſcerne, and what I would ſpeake, if I were to reaſon this matter in a free Parliament. But firſt I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and you and manie of my friendes well know, that I haue ſomewhat fleeted and altered concerning ſome pointes of this queſtion: yet at this preſent I am of that minde, and ſo, as I thinke, ſhal be ſtil, that the right ſhall be found in this king
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20381:70"/> of Scots to ſucceede to her, to whom we<note place="margin">The King of Scots next lawfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to her Maieſtie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the pedegree</note> wiſh, if it may pleaſe God, the length of Noah or Methuſelahs dayes: my reaſons I will firſt alleadge, and then anſwere to ſuch obiections as are to be met withall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I take this grounde as yeelded, that you and everie loyal &amp; true hearted Engliſhman will freelie confeſſe, if the Ladie Margaret, the eldeſt ſiſter of King Henry 8. were at this preſent aliue (the line of her brother ceaſing in our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene) that ſhe I ſay ſhoulde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controverſie be received, and by all England acknowledged to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie righteous and true heire to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and that all others ſhould giue place to that her right. Now ſeeing the ſaide king is the very next in deſcent from her, &amp; by a lawfull, vnſtained &amp; vnblemiſhed line by both parents, what conſcience or reaſon can warrant vs to defeat him, her next heire of that right, which by iuſt devolution is come to him, and which we (by our own confeſſions) ſtand bound to haue yeelded to her, if ſhee had at this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20381:71"/> day beene living to haue received it.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the obiections which<note place="margin">Obiections made by Dolman and others aganiſt the king of Scots anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> are made againſt this reaſon, and which ſeeme to be of ſome value, they are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at large by the Biſhop of Roſſe in his former book, but better in a late treatiſe privilie put out in his name, and in my ſmall iudgement, wel in that book which at our laſt conference you had in your hands. I will therefore deale with ſuch points, as none of the former haue fullie ſatisfied, or were not acquainted with, &amp; with ſuch as carryes ſome weight with ſome of our freinds. And theſe, Sir, are of two ſorts: either ſuch as directly aſſault his right or then ſuch as yeelding that he hath the beſt right, doe notwithſtanding maintaine that the Parliament may (for great regarde &amp; reſpectes importing this Realme) transfer his right from him to ſome other, whome it ſhal think good to make choiſe of. The impedimentes that are alleadged to barre his right are three: the firſt generall againſt his countrie and forraine birth: the other two are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20381:71"/> againſt the two braunches of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers lines.<note place="margin">1. Obiection of forraine birth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The impediment by reaſon of his birth, is grounded vpon a ſtatute made anno 25 Edwar. 3. which though by Roſſe and the reſt it bee verie well anſwered, yet two difficulties to ſuch as vnderſtand not the ſtatute, ſeeme to remain. The firſt is, that notwithſtanding divers praeſidents may bee brought of ſtrangers who haue obtained the crowne before the making of the ſaid ſtatute, yet none can be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged who ſince the making of the ſame hath got it. The other is, that her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie within theſe fewe yeeres, hath taken the opinion of ſome Iudges and Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants at lawe, concerning the meaning of the wordes, <hi>Enfants du Roy,</hi> which, as is ſaid they expounded to be no further ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended then to the firſt degree. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the former, the reaſon is plaine, why no ſtranger came to the crown ſince the making of this ſtatute, not becauſe the ſtatute was or could be anie let, but becauſe there was no ſtranger ſince that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20381:72"/> time before the nowe king of Scots, that coulde make anie claime to the crowne. To the ſecond, with reverence to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſaid Iudges be it ſpoken, if their reſolution was ſuch, the proviſo or excep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Enfants du Roy</hi> in the firſt degree, that is the Kings immediat children, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries neither ſenſe nor reaſon for they can not be ſaid in anie reſpect to be begotten of Parents out of the kings alleageance, being indeed begotten of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, of whome it were verie abſurde to ſay that hee were vnder or out of allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: but if you ſay they meant by the firſt degree the kings ſonnes children, or his nephewes, why I pray you ſhuld they more be called <hi>Enfants du Roy,</hi> then his Nephewes children, or their Nephewes, ſeeing there is the like reaſon for both. Now for ful anſwere to this obiection of his countrie, I will ſet againſt this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iudges and Sergeants and all other private opinions or expoſitions of anie men whatſoever, a publick iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lordes Iuſtices of both ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20381:72"/> given in the Kings bench Term.

For anſwere, the allegation of the former mariage, and it to be the cauſe of the divorce which enſued, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chooſe but ſeeme ridiculous to everie man that ſhall heare of it. For to what purpoſe ſhould ſo noble an Earle without anie cauſe haue formerly maried in a corner: or who will once think that his wife (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to haue beene aliue) would not haue made ſome hinderance or ſtop, at leaſt ſome challenge at the time of his mariage with the Ladie Margaret Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So as this Ladie might more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and honourablie haue ſhrunke back from the mariage and avoided it before it was ſolemnized, then to haue ſought to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20381:73"/> diſſolue it, it being once accompliſhed: and admit that this was the cauſe, yet it can ſtand with no reaſon that ſhe ſhould deferre it whole foure yeeres and more, and after all this while to ſeek then to be divorced from him, when he had iſſue by her. But they that are but meanlie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scottiſhe hiſtories knowes that this is, <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa,</hi> and that the true cauſe was, becauſe the Erle fel in loue with a gentle woman of Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas-dale, whome hee kept as his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, which his Ladie took ſo to heart, as ſhe would never be reeonciled to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that by this act he had defiled her bed ſuch was her Princelie minde. And it is reported of king Iames the fift that hee was accuſtomed to aske ſuch of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as were moſte inwarde with him, whither the ſaid gentle-woman were fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then his mother. So this act of the Earle of Angus falling out about ſome fowre yeeres after the birth of the Ladie<note place="margin">See Holinſ. compare pag. 303. with 306. in the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh hiſtorie.</note> Margaret Douglas his daughter, can no whit ſtain or embaſe her in blood, being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20381:74"/> begot and borne in lawfull mariage.</p>
                  <p>But for further proofe of the legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe was alwaies by all men taken &amp; reputed as the ſole and onlie heire to the Earle of Angus, and ſerved (as they call it) by the Scottiſh lawes to the ſaid Eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and had all the evidences &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings<note place="margin">Pag. 335.</note> of the ſame delivered to her, as to whome of right they did appertaine. But vpon the mariage of her ſonne the Lord Darnlie with the late Queene of Scots, ſhe was content, at the ſaid Queenes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to permit and yeeld the ſaid Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the diſpoſing of the Queene, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording her beſt liking, which honor and Earledome the ſaid Queene of Scots did beſtow vpon Archbald late Earle of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,<note place="margin">Fran. Thyne in his ſupplem to Holinſhed.</note> all which you may ſee at large in the Scottiſh and Engliſh Chronicles. And my Lord Dowglas, who at this preſent hath his lodging in Lyme-ſtreet, was the man, as I take it, that was ſent from the ſaid Queene to the Ladie Margaret, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then priſoner in the Tower, to treate of the reſignation of the Earledom, with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20381:74"/> this meſſage, It was a wel loſt Earledome which brought home a kingdom. Theſe are ſound proofes that the L. Margaret was no baſtard, and that this which is brought to impeach her legitimation, beeing truelie delivered, doth maynlie ſtrengthen the ſame. For mine own part, I make no queſtion (if her Maieſty would be pleaſed) but that my Lord Treaſurer, who hath ſifted this matter more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man, and who is eſteemed of all men to bee warie and wiſe enough, and not to bee any of the Scottiſhe Kings greateſt friends, would venture Sir Roberts young ſonne (though he be vnder yeeres) vppon Ladie Arbella, &amp; her title, albeit it come by this onely branche of the Ladie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Dowglas, and come alſo even in it a degree after the king and his children. And that you may the better belieue me, I pray you be remembred what attempt my Lord made for one of Sir Thomas his ſonnes. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this point, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver right my L. doth giue by this branch to the ſaid king collaterallie with Ladie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20381:75"/> Arbella, I ſee no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſeek to take it from him, knowing that moſt men comes ſhorte of my Lord in the ſearch and knowledge of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but verie few, or none ſhort of my L. in favour and affection towards him.</p>
                  <p>The obiection made againſt his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers line, is not ſo much the argument of any competitor or anie of their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or the doubt of anie of the skilfuller and better ſorte, as a ſcruple bred in the minds of the common people, ariſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I know not what buzing reporte of an act of Aſſociation, the truth of which is this. During the cuſtodie of the Scottiſhe Queene, there were diuerſe conſpiracies practized by Ieſuites, and other Papiſts &amp; male-contentes againſt our Soveraigne Ladie, not without the knowledge and privitie of the ſaid Queene, which courſe of conſpiracies &amp; treaſons, when the LL. of her Maieſties moſte honorable privie councell did diſcerne that they could by no meanes ſtop, ſo long as the Scottiſh Queene lived: and withall, that the only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20381:75"/> remedie to prevent them, was, that the Law ſhould take place for her triall. Yet fearing that her execution (if ſhe ſhould bee found guiltie) might be the cauſe of great ſturres &amp; troubles by reaſon of her great factions in the neighbour Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and of her favourers in this land, it ſeemed good to them, for withſtanding and repreſſing of ſuch commotions (if anie ſhoulde enſue) and for the better maintenance of the peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie which the ſtate did enioy, to make an act of Aſſociation, the tenor whereof, for your better ſatisfaction &amp; further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I haue thought good to ſet down at large, as followeth.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the act, and giveth it the force that it hath, and without which it may be as lightlie reiected, as it is by him weightily vrged: for it is well knowne, that by this act of aſſociation all were not bound, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manie refuſed to ſigne and ſeale the ſame, doubting what particulars might be carried vnder generall tearmes. Next, theſe inſtruments bound onelie the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreeing, of whom a great number are now dead, whoſe heires ſucceeding to their fathers places in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, muſt alſo renew in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons their fathers bonds, before the ſame proue anie thing preiudiciall. Thirdlie, manie did yeeld for feare or facility, who without all queſtion for ſuch like reſpects
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20381:82"/> will be alſo content to yeeld to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Laſtlie, it was a private order, and no act of Parliament, &amp; therevpon could be of no force or ſtrength to binde as a law, before it was confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And to yeeld a little further, thogh all the hands and ſeales in England had beene got to it, yet it coulde not trulie haue beene got to it, yet it coulde not trulie haue beene eſteemed or thought to be, or haue the force of an act of parliament, ſeeing they were not freelie and iointlie given, but ſecretelie and ſeverallie vrged and begged: whereby it is manifeſt that this matter is more in ſhew and report, then in ſubſtance and effect.</p>
                     <p>Again, if by this ſtatute, he meane the<note place="margin">Ormalice.</note> act of Parliament ratefying and allowing the act of aſſociation, he manifeſtlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth his impudencie and rooted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Scottiſh king, in miſallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the words of the ſtatute: for whereas the ſtatute bindes not the heires of anie that ſhoulde attempte or procure the Queens death, or be privy or acceſſory to the ſame, to anie penalty of loſſe of their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20381:82"/> right, claime, title, pretence or action, that they haue or may haue to the crown of England, vnleſſe they be conſenting there-vnto. On the contrarie, Dolman wittinglie and willingly, againſt his own conſcience (as it ſeemeth) perverteth the ſtatute, and in alleadging of it, leaveth out that clauſe, which he knewe woulde make moſt againſt him, and cleerelie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue that doubt, which before he iudged to admit no ſolution.</p>
                     <p>But without doubt, if Dolman was impudent in falſifying the ſtatute, he will peradventure be nothing aſhamed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, that the Scottiſh king was privie to his mothers conſpiracies, thereby to make that clauſe (of the heires not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting) fruſtrate and of no benefite to him. A ſhameleſſe perſon may affirme what he will, but this were an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to proue, and contrarilie, it is an eaſie matter to diſproue it: for who knoweth not that this were a moſt malicious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeeing in all the examinations &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſuch as were convicted for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20381:83"/> her actions, nothing could be found that might ſound that way: neyther indeede was it poſſible: for the actions of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſonne was ſo farre different, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt: the one a papiſt and a maintainer of ſuperſtition: the other a proteſtant and enemie to all ſuperſtition: the one adhering to that which was falſely called the holy league: the other puklikely oppoſed himſelfe to the ſame, and motioned a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league: the one a follower and favourer of the houſe of Guiſe, the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemie that Engl. had in their time, the other in a manner ruled &amp; governed by our Soveraigne, the ſureſt and firmeſt friend ſhe hath in Europe, as plainlie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared An. 1588. And brieflie the whole frame &amp; courſe of their liues was in ſome ſort one oppoſite to the other.</p>
                     <p>But to proceede further, though I ſhoulde admit that this clauſe were left out, and that the ſtatute, as Dolman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth, tooke hold, not onlie vpon the parties offending, but alſo vppon their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20381:83"/> heires, yet the Scottiſhe king can not be preiudiced in this caſe of the crown, if he may haue the benefit of the like preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to lean vnto, that others before him haue had, without fetching forrain examples, which might be infinitelie alleadged: I will content my ſelfe with the proofe of that which I affirme in two kings of this realme of late memorie, Edwarde 4. and Henrie 7. who were by Parliaments at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, and holden convicte of high treaſon, notwithſtanding this was no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment or hinderance to them to barr them from enioying the crowne when their time came. I am not ignorant that it was aunſwered by ſome concerning them two &amp; ſuch others, that they came to the crowne as being called by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not by any vertue and force of their right. But it may be more trulie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they tel but a tale: for all Engl. knoweth that they came in before they were ſent for by Parliament, &amp; clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it by ſword before they were called or then they might haue gone without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20381:84"/> it for ever. Nay, the Parliaments did no otherwiſe admit them at all, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of their rights and claimes. And who doubts that the houſe of Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſhould haue good right, if the former rights were ſpent and ceaſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the moſte of them by whome it doeth claime, were by King Henrie the eight, and his father King Henrie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth for treaſons cut off, &amp; their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">Margaret counteſſe of Salisburie &amp; her ſonne Henry Poole.</note> allowed by Parliament. I think ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie the Scottiſhe King is to looke for no leſſe favour then ſo lately her Maieſties grand-father &amp; great grand-father haue had: yea, and all they which ſince that time without any queſtion or impeache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue enioyed the ſcepter by them, and which others may hope for if it ſhall come to their turne. And the rather that his loue to our Prince and countrie, and the friendſhip and amitie by him main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained hath bene firmer and ſurer during all his raigne, then it was in the time of any his progenitours, notwithſtanding hee hath had greater occaſions of gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20381:84"/> and they more bonds which might haue tied them vnto vs. M. Bowes making relation of ſome of the Kings Chriſtian ſpeeches, proteſted, that hee hath heard the King ſay manie times, that he would not be touched ſo much as in thought with a deſire of her Maieſties death, if it might gaine him the preſent poſſeſſion of all her dominions: yea of all the realmes and kingdomes of the world. And he added further that he heard him diſcourſe moſt wiſelie and religiouſlie of the impietie and madnes of ſome men, who by the iuſt judgements of God haue defeated themſelves for ever, of that, which in due ſeaſon they might haue come vnto, if they had not followed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and wicked courſes to compas it, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the juſt time at which they ſhoulde haue got it. Laſtlie, to admit with Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that this ſtatute was good and of ſufficient force to barre the Queene of Scots, and all ſuch as might claime that way, yet all this cannot defeate or hinder the Scottiſhe King of that right
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20381:85"/> which commeth in to him by his father, and which hath the firſte and next place, if his mothers title ſhould abate and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, as I haue alreadie ſufficientlie prooved.</p>
                     <p>But this abuſe and deceiving of the common people by miſ-reporting the tenor and intent of the act of Aſſociation is (by the like meanes of whiſpering and muttering in the eares of the ignorant) ſeconded with an other ſuggeſtion and ſlander more groſſe and impudent then the former, for the better perſwading &amp; helping forwardes (as it may ſeeme) of the other error. So as both of them doth appeare to bee derived from the ſame fountaine. And this is it forſooth, that as the Scottiſhe King is debarred from the<note place="margin">The opinion of conferring to the Queen by Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the ſucceſſor by her laſt will confuted.</note> crowne by one act of Parliament, ſo her Maieſtie by another act of Parliament hath the diſpoſing of it referred to her laſt will, of purpoſe to defeate the ſaide King, as they would beare vs in hand. As though her Maieſtie were deprived of memorie and reaſon, and had quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20381:85"/> the fruit of ſuch pretended willes of her noble brother and father, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to followe and embrace ſuch courſes by which her ſiſter and ſhee, were like to haue loſt their kingdomes, liberties and lives: or that through ignorance ſhe doth vnder-goe too weghtie a burthen for the whole kingdome to beare: to wit, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the crowne by diſcretion, and ſeeth not, that ſhe doth ſowe the ſeede of horrible miſeries, which are to ſpring &amp; grow from ſo crabbed and wicked roote. But if they will not haue her ſo forgetful and ſenſeleſſe, as I am ſure they will not, then are they more iniurious to her: who doth make her to ſeeke purpoſelie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke her moſte faithfull and loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes in moſte furious and raging ſeas of dole-full calamities after her death, whome ſhe hath bene ſo carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in all her lifetime: and withall will haue her (contrary to al her moſt prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie courſes) to bee more led with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt reſpect of ſome perſon, her affection, or will, then to be ruled with the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20381:86"/> of good right, the true heire, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and reaſon. They deſerue ill her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favours who weigh not (ſo as their lies may take place) how highlie they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from her ſacred honour. Howe deepelie they impeache her of falſhood in violating her promiſes and leagues, made and ratified with the Scottiſh king, and his mother, and ſo often renued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſte honourable witneſſes of both the Realmes, and by manie Embaſſadors at ſeveral times. I mervaile ſtrangely how they can bee ignorant of her Maieſties moſt excellent and moſt wiſe ſpeech deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Metland the Scottiſh Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour concerning this ſame purpoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the third yeere of her raigne, which is extant to the view of all thoſe that can or will read the ſame, both in our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles which are <hi>Cum Privilegio,</hi> and in the Scottiſh Chronicles permitted to be vſed heere freelie of all men.

Laſtlie, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is a mayne point, the Scottiſh king will be more affected to his owne, &amp; advance them to places of chiefe credite &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance about him: ſo as the greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie that Engl. can look for is like to be the increaſe of more ſubiects. For the better cleering of theſe inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which in deede make great impreſſions in the mindes of manie Engliſh-men, I will handle theſe three thinges in order. Firſt, whither for the alleadged reſpectes a Parliament can haue that power to take from him his right. Secondlie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe reſpectes or inconveniences alleadged are like to proue true. Thrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to whom (if not to him) it can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with the avoidance of theſe ſame
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20381:89"/> or the like, or rather greater.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for the power of the Parliament,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it hath take away a Kings right to the crown.</note> according to the bounden duetie of a faithfull and loyall ſubiect, and the place which I haue beene vouchſafed in it. I do acknowledge, and from my hart confeſſe that it is moſt ſacred, moſt ample &amp; large and hath prerogatiues and preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces farre aboue anie Court what ſoever, which is eſtabliſhed by God vnder the heavens. But yet with the confidence of a good conſcience I am bold to advouch that which is the ground and foundation of al diſputation in the Parliament houſe to witte, That the power and authoritie which it hath, is ſtraightlie ſtinted &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with the limites &amp; meeres of iuſtice and equitie: and is appointed by God, as the power next to himſelfe to reforme and redreſſe wrongs and outrages which can not be holpen by any other meanes, and by good and wholeſome lawes to procure the peace and wealth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. So as, the neerer it is to God, the more ſound, ſincere and vpright it ought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20381:90"/> to be, beeing the Court of moſt pure and exquiſite iudgement. If therefore by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the great power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which it hath, it doe iniurie to anie man, or doe tranſgreſſe the bondes of right, I ſay this tranſgreſſion is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of before God, not as the ſinne of one private man, one Prelate, noble-man or Citizen, but as a combination &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie of all the Prelates, noble-men &amp; Citizens, yea, and of all the people of the whol land, to pronounce for pure iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, heynous iniquitie from the bench of higheſt Iuſtice. To this I adde further, that a Prince which hath the right (as we ſpeake) of God, he is the ordinance, not of anie man, but of God, appointed and ſubſtituted by God himſelfe, as his deputy for the maintenance of his truth, and to miniſter Iuſtice according to the good and wholeſome lawes of that land over which he doeth place him. Theſe grounds thus laide, I ſay, if the religious and wiſe king of Scots (having this right of God, as the alleadger of theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20381:90"/> doe admit) be willing to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne vs according to our owne lawes (as no queſtion he will) it were the higheſt iniuſtice that England could do, for ſuch ſurmiſes of imagined inconvenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enſue, to goe about to offer or doe to him that wrong, which is appointed, yea before God, in reſpecte of his right annointed to bee the chiefe Officer and miniſter of Iuſtice and right to everie of vs after her Maieſtie. So the wickednes of this fact ſhall abound in this, if wee take from him his beſt right, who ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs from all ſorts of wronges. But ſome haue anſwered, that the Parliament may and hath taken the rightfull lands and liuings of men, and hath repealed the acts &amp; ſtatutes of former Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. To this I replie, that as in a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die no man can be allowed to cutte off a member for blemiſhe or imperfection: but is eſteemed wiſelie and rightlie to take that member away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which without the helpe of ſuch remedie was manifeſtly diſcerned to endaunger the reſt. So the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20381:91"/> members of the politicke bodie may vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the like reſpect of daunger, and not for likelyhoodes and imaginations, or ſurmiſed inconveniences (ſuch as the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged) are take away the lands, liuings, yea, or life of anie ſubiect. But where is this danger to be ſhewed here? ſeeing he will peaceablie governe vs, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our religion and lawes. And to ſay ſomewhat further, though our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may haue that power over every Engliſh ſubiect, as well competitours as others, to take or keepe backe from them (becauſe they are vnder our power, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of our owne bodie) that which otherwiſe is their due and right. Yet it is to be doubted whither it may likewiſe take or keepe backe his good right from the Scottiſh king, who is no ſubiect, neyther anie member incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vs, but is the heade of an other politicke bodie. And this is a doubt, or rather Iudgement of ſome of the beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in England.</p>
                     <p>Againe, whenſoever a Parliament is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20381:91"/> ſaid to haue taken away mens lands or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, or to haue repealed anie act or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a former Parliament, it is euer to be vnderſtood of lands, livings, and actes, which did concerne private men &amp; not Princes. To whome whatſoever hath beene given by a free and lawfull Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſtand and to remaine to them and their heires, I think you ſhal not find altered or taken away by another free Parliament, vnleſſe it were with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſaid Princes, or their heires to whome it was formerlie given: take for example the reſignation of Richard the ſecond. And therefore I take this for a ſure and ſound principle: If all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the whole Realme by common &amp; voluntarie conſent, for themſelves and their poſteritie, do transferre and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of themſelues and their ſtate into the hands of ſome choſen man, to bee governed by him and his heires for ever, according to ſuch and ſuch lawes, as they ſhall agree vppon, or haue alreadie eſtabliſhed: that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20381:92"/> in reaſon (if he be willing to preſerue their lawes) thinke, that that power doth yet reſt in themſelues, of which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the people iointlie giving, and the Prince receiving, they had formerlie diſpoſſeſſed themſelves. And if this bee true <hi>Par non habet poteſtatem in parem,</hi> then much more this, <hi>minor non habet in matore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And by conſequence this poſterity thus diſpoſſeſſed of the power and intereſt of beſtowing the right, cannot make voide the act of their anceſtors, in whome the ſaide power and right was actuallie and reallie, to diſpoſe of their government before they beſtowed it. Neither can the act of the reſt of the members without the head &amp; againſt it, be of that power &amp; force that the ioined act of the head and whole members together is. For further proofe heereof, when the whole line of Salomon ceaſed in Ieconias, coulde all the Iewes in the world by anie act, haue given the right of the title fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe of Nathan? Though Salathiell the next ſucceſſor of his line was about 38 degrees
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20381:92"/> diſtant from the ſaid Ieconias, and the ground of his title aboue 400. yeeres old (and might therefore haue bene weaker more litigious, doubtfull and obſcure, then it can be in the Scottiſh king, who is but the fifth in diſcent in direct line from the roote. Nay the ſame Ieco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias before his deliverance out of priſon<note place="margin">M. Broughton</note> (as is well declared by our famous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie-man) appointed the ſaid Salathiel to be his heire apparant, for which reſpect the Scripture ſpeaketh of him, as of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conias ſonne, ſaying that hee did beget him. And the ambition of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, vſurping (not without the pretence of manie worthie reſpects) the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſword in the weakneſſe of the houſe of David, eſcaped not an horrible judgement of God, who gaue them vp to ſlaughter and murther one another, &amp; to be led with the ſprit of errors and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils. Alexander one of their kings beeing a Saducie (as manie more of them were) killed 50000. Phariſies. Antigonus another king died with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20381:93"/> of conſcience, &amp; vomiting blood. Iudas and all his brethren fell by the ſword, others were poiſoned, almoſt none died but by violence. And thus by God the revenger of the oppreſſed, that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, though valiaunt, familie which againſt right had exalted it ſelfe, was headlong throwne downe and brought to a moſt ſhamefull and miſerable end. By all which it is moſt evident &amp; plaine, that not Iudas, or Simeon Macchabeus, becauſe they were valiaunteſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for many true and good reſpects ſeemed fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt at that time to haue protected &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the oppreſſed and diſtreſſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God: but ſome Matthan or Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph (though verie poore and baſe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were moſte rightfull to the crowne, and they being rulers appointed by God ſhould haue had the governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and guiding of Iuda. And ſo Sir, to make an ende of this firſte reaſon, I pray you thinke with your ſelf if it ſhould fall out, that the Parliament for manie reſpectes ſhould beſtow the crown quite contrary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20381:93"/> to the expectation of theſe men, who ſtand ſo preciſely for the abſolute power and ſoveraignetie of it: imagine, I ſay, that ſuch a thing fel out, do not you think that the caſe would be altered with them and perhaps, then would bee more bent againſt it, then nowe they are for it, this beeing alwaies ſuch mens deſire to haue the Parliaments followe them, and not they the Parliaments. But the meaneſt &amp; ſimpleſt in al the land knowes this much I hope, that the wiſeſtmen of the Realme are choſen out and ſent to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, not to determine or eſtabliſhe whatſoever they will, but to adviſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and diſcerne what in reaſon &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience they ought &amp; ſhould determine and conclude.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Parliament cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> defeat the lawfull ſucceſſor, is plaine by the iudgement of the Parliament it ſelfe: which in the coronation of any King or Prince, giueth not this reaſon of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it ſeemed good to the Nobles and commons ſo to do, and ſo to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20381:94"/> advaunce him: but quite contrarie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is next and true heire and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to ſuch or ſuch a Prince of late &amp; famous memory, therefore it is his right that the &amp; none elſe ſhould be advanced. As who would ſay: he is not heire or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor becauſe the Parliament declareth him to be ſo, but becauſe hee is ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that the Parliament by right ought and doeth declare him to bee ſo. Which ground and reaſon of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dooing is ſo apparant and plaine, that the verie vſurpers, who were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſequeſtred from all reaſon &amp; right, thought it not ſufficient to be eſtabliſhed and confirmed by Parliament, vnles they had ſome ground or ſhewe of ſucceſſion to warrand it withall. So Henrie the fourth did more reſt vpon the blind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a claim by Edmond crook-back, then vppon the voice of the Parliament, though it were ſtrengthened with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of Richard the ſecond. Alſo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the third rather then hee woulde haue bene without ſome ſhew of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20381:94"/> howe bare and weake ſoever, did<note place="margin">Sir Thomas More in the ſtorie of his raigne.</note> chooſe to cauſe proclaime at Paules Croſſe, his mother an harlot, &amp; his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren baſtards. And thus hee ſought the kingdome no otherwiſe, then by right of ſucceſſion, as doeth plainlie appeare by the determination of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, Doctor Shawes preaching, &amp; the Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinghames ſpeech in King Richards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, to the ſame effect. By which you ſee, that even in the conceit of the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers themſelves, the moſte lying, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and falſely forged pretence of next and moſt lawful blood, is to be preferred before any Parliament, as beeing the ground and warrand for iuſtifying and cleering the acts and doings of the ſame And if the crowne might be lawfully gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the pleaſure of a Parliament, what reaſon is there to call Rich. 3. or any ſuch others, vſurpers: for they cannot deſerue ſo odious a name, receiving the crowne no otherwiſe, then at the hand of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. To ſhut vp this ſecond reaſon, vnles the right of ſucceſſion were a thing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20381:95"/> impregnable by any Parliament, by what reaſon, or with what face could the Duke of Yorke or Edward the fourth, ſo boldly &amp; confidentlie haue claimed the crown in the verie Parliament it ſelfe. Or howe coulde the Realme of England haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged it to them, which by ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments going before had bene confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to three ſeverall Kings of the houſe of Lancaſter.</p>
                     <p>My laſt reaſon (which I pray God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man whome it doeth concerne may take to heart, and chieflie they who are ſet at the helme) is brought from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and bloodie fruites which wee haue reaped by ſuch baſtard ſucceſſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by Parliaments. Theſe dolefull remembrances ſhould now make vs wiſe leaſt in the end we be taught by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of fooles. Of al theſe that ſince the daies of the Conquerour haue wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie attained to the crowne, and haue had it confirmed by voice of Parliament, who is almoſte hee or ſhee, that hath not beene forced to leaue it, with an expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20381:95"/> of blood. I doe heere referre mee to our Chronicles, to the vſurpers, their adhaerents and complices, and to a migh tie number alſo of the guiltleſſe and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſide. Yea who doth not know that this manner of wrongfull intruſion into the higher powers and places hath often times procured rightfull Kings vpon ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſuſpicion to cut away ſuch of their own blood, as they did feare would take advantage of the like courſes. To conclude theſe my reaſons concerning the limited power of the Parliaments, I beſeech God, that they may rather ſeeke to maintaine their honorable power, by dooing that which is conſcionable and right, then to bolſter out wrong by the ſtrength of their power, ſeing there is no wiſdome nor counſell, nor any ſtrength of man that can prevaile againſt him who doth over-rule all things by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power.</p>
                     <p>It followeth next to examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for which ſome Engliſh-man may be thought fitter to be advanced to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20381:96"/> government of the realme: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, objected by Dolman in admitting the King of Scots to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, refuted</note> it be yeelded that the king of Scots hath the true right. The firſt is this, there be manie Engliſh competitors, who will not indure a ſtranger to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, for that they ſhall never bee free from his ielouſie, which cannot bee without the hazarde of their liues, the trouble of the realme, and that to fortify himſelf againſt them, he ſhall needes be conſtrained to bring in forraine forces. To theſe points I do anſwere: firſt, that he is no ſtranger as is alreadie proved, and if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his right bee from God, all the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (though they were a thouſand more then they are) ſtand bound to receiue him, vnleſſe wilfullie againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience they wil ſeeme to become adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both to God and man. Secondlie what if he do anſwere that hee will haue them to indure him to guide and to rule them, and that he will be more vnwilling to for goe his right at their vniuſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, then they will to yeeld it to him at his iuſt demand. Thirdly, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:20381:96"/> they bee, for them it is ſo much the worſe, for a kingdom devided againſt it ſelfe cannot long ſtand, ſo as this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction maketh more againſt themſelves &amp; our Realme, then againſt the Scottiſhe King: for whoſoever get the victorie, wee are ſtill overthrowne, and this is the onlie meanes that will weaken them all. Fourthlie, if anie of them ſhould wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> attaine to it, is it like that he would truſt the reſt of the Competitors or their familiars? Nay, as Salomon ſaith, a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conſcience doth feare where there is no cauſe, much more would he I trowe, that ſhould come by it wrongfullie be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted &amp; trubled dayly, to behold ſuch eie-ſores, who wer ſet for his kingdom &amp; life. The regarde of their country, kinred or acquaintance woulde but little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him or them to truſt the one to the other: for according to the old proverbe, a crowne will know no kinred. And it is probable that the reſt of the competitors if they muſt needs go without it, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it ſooner to him that hath the right,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20381:97"/> then to anie man elſe, eſpeciallie he bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a king, and of ſuch favour, force and affinity with our neighbour Princes. But moſt of all, for that they may well thinke if they do not cleaue to him, yet there be manie others of their countrie that will. Fiftlie, I confeſſe there be more that are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> called Competitours then I wiſhe there were, but I ſtand fullie aſſured that none but one can haue the true right, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who ſoever hath it not, if he can ſee it, and be wiſe, will follow him that hath it, that he may ſatiſfy his conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce when his cauſe is good, and prevent the ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and overthrow, which now he doeth, or hereafter may feare when the true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor ſhall come by his right. Sixtlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> though the competitours bee manie, yet they are nothinge ſuch, as within theſe few yeeres they haue beene: yea they and their favourers (of whome there was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie valiant and wiſe) are ſo removed by the will of God and taken out of his way, as it may ſeeme that there is a mightie providence of God ſtrongly working for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20381:97"/> him to defend him in his right. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the way for the Competitours to bee freed from ielouſie, is to preſerue the publike peace of the countrie, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and to avoid &amp; eſcape the forces and tirannie of ſtrangers is, not to refuſe him his right, but rather chearefullie &amp; before all others to further him to it: for if they who ſhould be his own do wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie reſiſt him, who can iuſtlie blame him, if he take the aide of ſtrangers, and if by ſuch meanes the peace of the realm ſhould be diſturbed, the cauſe of it is not in him, that askes nothinge elſe but his owne, but in them, who againſt all equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie refuſe to giue him the ſame. Woulde to God we could weigh and conſider this in reaſon, that they are moſt worthie to dwell ſtill in trouble, who wittinglie and willinglie are readie to procure it. Laſtly ſeeing the troublers of their own houſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> ſhall inherite the winde, the competitors if they haue a minde to enioy their livin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, liberties and liues, are rather to ſeeke inſtantlie that by a lawfull Parliament
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20381:98"/> the title may be tryed, &amp; given to whom of right it doeth belong: for the throne is not eſtabliſhed by iniquitie, but hee ſhall beſt brooke it who ſhoulde haue it by right. By this meanes the competitors ſhall be ſecured, the ſeate of the Prince more fortified, by his good title beeing acknowledged and confirmed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ever it could bee by anie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine forces: all parties ſhall bee pleaſed, and both theſe noble realmes which doe at this preſent enioy the light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſhall be ſatiſfied and ſetled in peace and tranquillitie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon that is alleadged in transferring the right of the Scottiſhe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> king to ſome Engliſh-man, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Al En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-men will follow Engliſh competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (for we can not brooke well the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſtrangers) and if wee ioine faſt together for the countries ſake, wee ſhall be ſtrong enough againſt the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh king and all his confederates. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, If wee may beleeue the Spirit of God, they that haue thus percloſed their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20381:98"/> reckonings ſhall finde themſelves ſhort of the iuſt accompt: for when the wayes of a man are acceptable to God, hee will make all things in league with him: yea, and his verie enemies to become his friends. If therefore the king of Scots do follow a good cauſe by good and lawfull meanes, I doubt not but many thouſands will follow him, which wee haue not as yet thought of.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, ſay (Sir) that all the Engliſhmen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> follow Engliſh competitors, yet we haue ſome reaſon to doubt of the Welſh-men,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20381:99"/> who are not ſo much led with affection to vs, as they are carried to him with the loue of their ſuppoſed kinred and blood, and poſſeſſed with the credite of their old prophecie bookes. And whome (may we ſay) doe theſe Engliſh-men followe, whoſe leaders beeing competitors doth adhere to the king, eyther for hatred of the other, or for conſcience, or for feare, or for hope. Yet I admit he get neither En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh nor Walſhe, but that both of them ſticke faſt to the Engliſh competitours, and ioine all their endevours and forces to aid and aſſiſt them. Are wee not then ioined together, like ioined ropes of ſand?

And it may ſeeme a ſtrange pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe to a man of vnderſtanding, that rather then we would be friends and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to the Scottiſh king, we are content to be adverſaries and enemies to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: and ſo as wee may avoide him, care
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20381:99"/> not to be overthrowne. For though he &amp; his confederates ſhould willingly forgoe vs. wee are never a whit the better. Nay, then much worſe, for by that meanes the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Competitors is put further of from an end. The reaſon is plaine, if the firſt right and beſt bee diſplaced for ſome reſpectes, will there not be as great or greater reſpectes found againſt the ſecond &amp; third. I durſt pleadge my head, that there woulde not bee wanting ſome great and popular perſonages, who with ſome reſpecte or aſpecte to themſelves woulde alleadge greater reſpects againſt all the Engliſh competitors then anie of theſe be which are alleadged againſt the king of Scots. And thus by the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and their complices, without the helpe of the Scottiſhe king or his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, wee are made ſtrong enough to deſtroy our ſelves for certane reſpectes. For remedie of this inconvenience, if the right be his, I thinke that conſcience &amp; our naturall affection to the ſafety of our ſelves and our countrie ſhoulde make vs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20381:100"/> moſt willingly and heartily receaue him: of which there may bee the better hope conceived, for that our nation is of it ſelf more enclined to the ſubjection of our Prince, to obedience to our lawes, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and to right, then anie other people which is betweene the two poles. And who can ſay for certaine whither manie haue not alreadie received him in their heartes? The ſurmiſes for it are great. What ſhould make vs thinke but that Proteſtants would embrace him for loue of Religion? Both Proteſtants and civill Papiſts (as I may tearme them for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they haue none) for a regard of his right? the reſt of the Papiſts for feare of an heavier yoak? (for none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could ever expect greater favour at anie ſucceſſors handes, then at his, who hath already ſhewed himſelf too too remiſſe in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſo manie of his owne ſubiectes of their profeſſion: neither is there any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor a Papiſt of whome they might look to attaine their deſires.) Laſtlie, the Neuters for hope of advanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20381:100"/> they loue as their God, or for feare to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde and periſh their eſtate, which they ſhunne and hate as the Divell, woulde a thouſand to one ſooner ſubmit themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, then in vaine oppoſe to both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two. And to conclude this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, though hand ſhoulde ioine in hand to commit iniquitie, yet the Lorde of Hoſtes hath meanes to diſſolue, caſt down, caſt away, and to deſtroy: for what the Lorde ſtandeth for, no Policie ſhall ſtop it.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon for giving the crown to ſome Engliſh-man from the Scottiſh King is, the naturall averſion of the two nations, which (as ſome do affirme) will never agree though they were made one To this I anſwere, that it is a bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption without any good ground or warrant. Nay, the contrarie is true as we al ſee: for during her Maieſties moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie government, we and they by meanes of the league and amity of the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue ſtil maintained brotherly friend ſhip and peace, in ſo much that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20381:101"/> of our olde enmitie is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vtterlie vaniſhed and gone. Now if the concord and league of the Princes hath bene able to make and to continue vs both quiet after this ſort, why may we not much more bee linked in a mitie and ſound friendſhip, when of two nations we are made one, by the vnitie of one &amp; the ſame Prince, ſeeking with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent affection the quietneſſe and peace of both Realmes, as beeing one, like to him ſelf?</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, this reaſon of the progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated diſ-agreement to diſſwade their vniting, is in effect, and doth ſo ſound in my eare, as if one ſhould ſay: This ſick &amp; diſeaſed man wil hardlie brooke his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, though he ſhould be made to take it, therefore if you will be adviſed by mee you ſhal miniſter him none: which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought rather to bee inverted &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over to this forme. Theſe two Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes could never hitherto agree becauſe they were ſtill kept as two: therefore to worke and ſettle their agreement, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20381:101"/> ſolutelie neceſſarie, that they bee vnited in one, that the ground and occaſion of all the warres being taken away, al their contentions and battels may likewiſe ſur ceaſe. But if any man be ſo weake to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that becauſe the diſcorde of the two Nations hath bene great: therefore their agreement can never be firme: he might by the ſame reaſon think, becauſe we haue fought more battailes, and had bitterer warres, againſt and amongſt our ſelves, then ever wee had with the Scots: that therefore the concorde and peace which our Nation did enioy vnder our Soveraigne Queene, it cannot be ſound, and that it were much eaſier to make a perfect amitie and vnion with the Scots, then that wee coulde be brought to bee faithfull and true hearted friendes with our ſelves. Well, the times and ſeaſons doe change, and all thinges doe by them alter and turne, ſo as nothing can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie ſtand at one ſtay, except that God, that turneth the wheeles of all thinges, ſtay the ſame: we are therefore to labour
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20381:102"/> to change to the beſt, and ſeeing by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are ſo careleſſe to be conſtant in good things, let vs never endevour to be conſtant in bad things: for he that by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie of Religion can ſet the father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne ſonne, can by the power and efficacie of his true Religion make of mortall enemies moſt faithfull friendes, and having ſo made them, hee can conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them ſo. Let God be iuſtified in his truth, and men manifeſted to bee lyars: when God is obeyed and his ordinance followed, it ſhall haue a bleſſing, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the expectation of men: for it is to be thought, that he may moue the harts of anie ſubiects, who doth at his pleaſure command the hearts of all Princes. And trulie in the ſight &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of man, it may ſeeme that at this preſent God hath a purpoſe to vnite vs, having in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce diſpoſed of ſo many effectual means amongſt vs, all which do concurre moſt forciblie to accompliſhe that worke, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of true Religion (which never doth want the bond of the ſpirit) vnitie of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20381:102"/> likenes of diſcipline and manners, the long peace and concorde of the Princes and countries, the often &amp; next deſcent of the Scottiſhe king from the bloode royall of England, his rare wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and loue of Religion, with ſound knowledge and iudgement in matters of the ſame, doeth divine ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie charge &amp; imployment from God, (for graces are never given but to fitte ſome place and calling anſwearable to them) the propagation from vs of manie of their nobleſt families, and no ſmall number of their meaner houſes (which doe carrie our ſurnames to this preſent day) doeth in a manner invite vs to bee of one familie or houſhold. The removall of the moſte wiſe, heroicall and popular competitors and their favourers, which might haue oppoſed, doeth ſmooth and plaine a way for him to come in. And the two countries, by ſeas not diſ-vnited, but making one Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, doth wiſh the two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make vp one people. Other means there are, which I doe heere omit, of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20381:103"/> which a part are verie well ſet downe in the late Scottiſhe proclamation (full of affection and loue to vs) ſet out for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparation againſt the Spaniards, and for the maintenance of peace of the borders, penned (as I am crediblie infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) by the king himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The laſt inconvenience which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to be mervailous, and to bring more contempt &amp; danger to the Engliſh ſtate then all the other three, is this. The Scottiſhe king will be more affected to the Scots, and will advance them to the chiefe places of credite and confidence about him: ſo the Engliſh which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beene accuſtomed to command and rule other nations, and not to obey or be ruled by anie, ſhall become ſubiect not only to the king, but alſo to the Scots whom once they did conquere. And this no Engliſh heart can indure. Beſides the greateſt commoditie that England can looke for, is like to bee none other, then the increaſe of more ſubiects. If this were true, as it is alleadged, it were contempt,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20381:103"/> domage and danger I confeſſe, and could no waies be pleaſing to any Engliſhman to be ſubiect to thoſe whome they count their inferiors. But it may be more trulie anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is obiected, that we need not doubt of his future affection, whoſe favour from time to time hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie proved by good evidences, to all ſuch of our nation as hath ſtoode in need of it. I haue heard divers of them openlie confeſſe, that they had better hearing more gracious aunſweres, and ſpeedier diſpatches from him, then anie of his owne ſubiectes coulde get, or yet they themſelves could ever get of the Queen: and ſpeciallie one, whoſe ſute (for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Engliſhman that was committed to priſon and condemned to be hanged) the king (though much buſied) patientlie heard, red his petition, and (proteſting that he had rather hang twentie of his owne knaues, then the poore man ſhould take anie harme) gaue preſent direction for his enlargement, though manie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were alleadged to the contrarie by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20381:104"/> ſome of his Nobility that were moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with him. This matter fel out verie lately as he that heard it of the petitioner himſelf did aſſure me. Yet this is nothing in reſpect of that which hee hath ſhewed during al the ſpace of aboue twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty yeres. So as I hope hee is of that princelie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that wee ſhall never be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him with kindenes. And I woulde know what iuſt occaſion haue we thus to imagine, and thus to gheſſe what his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and inclination muſt bee at anie or at all times hereafter: as though everie man without poſſibilitie of divorce were ſo wedded to one affection, that no thing could alter or change it: when as we ſee that men of wiſdome and of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doe rule and frame their affections according to the better reſpectes, and as they ſee greater reaſon. Therefore wee may the more ſafelie conclude, that hee that is now perhaps more tenderlie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to his owne, becauſe he is more bounde to them by the rules of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and nature, will hereafter be more,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20381:104"/> or at leaſt no leſſe affected to vs, if there be the like or greater reſpectes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of conſcience and nature why hee ſhould do ſo. Neither can his preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and favour be a ſufficient rule or ſquare, by which you may meaſure and iudge what his affection ſhall bee at all times to come. We are fully &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie taught, even by the inſtinct of nature, that the vileſt monſter which ſhe bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, or the cruelleſt beaſt which ſhee nouriſheth, will favour and fane vp thoſe of whome they haue good. And will not he to whom the heavens are ſo benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in furniſhing him with rare graces and gifts of bodie and minde, advaunce, preferre, and make much of thoſe, who haue or ſhall chearefullie and willinglie advance &amp; preferre him before al others, even of their own nation. To whom (may we thinke) can hee more ſafelie commit his perſon &amp; his ſtate, then to them who for the confidence and aſſurance which they doe repoſe in him, haue committed to his truſt, their livinges, liberties, liues,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20381:105"/> and all that ever they can haue. Nay, it is wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hout all queſtion, that he who is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and by both his parents deſcended of Engliſh blood, wil in England becom Engliſh and a favorer cheiflie of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according to the ſpeech (if not the prophecie) of his moſt noble aunceſtor, King Henrie the ſeventh, who in anſwere of the ſame doubt affirmed to his hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable counſell, that he made no queſtion if any ſuch thing ſhould fall out, but the Scottiſh king beeing (as all Princes are by their royall nature) enclined to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, to ſtatelines, to eloquence, to poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; to civilitie, ſhould frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe to the better countrie, &amp; be taken with a liking of the more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſcipline, faſhions, and carriage of England, the rather for that hee hath ſo ample and large a rewarde propoſed to him for the ſame. The meaneſt Scottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are ſetled in England are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to forget their countrie, kindred, &amp; Parents, and to frame and apply themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves vnto vs, that they may freelie enjoy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20381:105"/> their poore condition or calling. And is it like that hee who may ſtill retaine his ſubjectes, his countrie, his Queene, and children, will not apply himſelf to vs, in our lawfull and honourable deſires, that hee may rule vs? Likeneſſe of manners doeth conciliate and faſten affections. Therefore for mine owne part I doubt not but ere he haue beene any long time with vs, he ſhall be ſo wonne to vs, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhed with vs, by our naturall and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obedience to our Prince aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, and by al the verteous and commendable parts of our civilitie, that Scotland ſhall haue more cauſe to feare their ſubiection to ſome Engliſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, then wee haue nowe to feare our ſubiection to the Scots. Trulie I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile not a little when I do conſider how vnwilling and froward wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that kingdome beeing offered, which we haue fought for moſte egerlie for manie hundreth yeers. Is not this the way to ſubordinate (if not to ſubdue) to vs, that people by policie, whome wee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20381:106"/> coulde not by force? Who beares the loſſe when we get the gain? They depart with the beſt member that their bodie can afforde, that they may become one bodie with vs. And to ſpeake as I thinke, in taking their King wee take alſo their kingdome, which was wiſelie foreſeene of the afore-ſaid Prince, who ſtoode per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the worthier kingdome would annexe and drawe to it the leſſer and weaker, and for the ſame purpoſe his moſte famous ſonne King Henrie the eight did earneſtlie affect and go about at ſeverall times, by promiſes, policies, giftes and threatninges to vnite the two Realmes, and their two Princes: firſt, when, with the allegation and aunſwere of this our doubt, hee made offer of his onlie daughter and heire Ladie Mary to king Iames the fift, (the place of Holinſ. is worth the reading) And after when he ſought in mariage for Prince Edward his ſonne, the young Princeſſe the late Queene of Scotland: ſo as the refuſall of the firſt, and breache of the laſt beeing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20381:106"/> once agreed vppon, was the occaſion of bitter warres, and great blood-ſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two nations. And nowe the difference is no other then this that wee did ſeek before to annexe them vnto vs, and that they do ſeeke now to be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs. Therfore the ods is ours that they who did latelie refuſe to giue vs their Queene, are now moſt willing and content that wee doe take their King. Wherein, in my opinion, we ſhould bee as forward to receiue them, as they are willing to make offer of themſelves, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is plaine by proofe of experience, that we ſhall no leſſe keep our prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence aboue the Scots, though wee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to the Scottiſh king, then wee haue kept it to this preſent day over the Walſh-men, notwithſtanding wee did ſubmit our ſelves to King Henrie the ſeaventh. Yet on the part wee are not to think or expect, that he will quite abandon or baniſh them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being about him, for that were rather to rent them of from vs, then to encorporate them with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20381:107"/> vs in one Politicke bodie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond point for the commodity it will bee much more then the bare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſubjectes, if the opinion of a moſt faithfull and wiſe counſeller (as any this land hath) may haue anie credite with vs: who thought it the onlie ſafetie of England to ſtand fullie aſſured of our back dore. And indeede wee had never more neede to haue it faſt, then at this time being environed and compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſo manie malicious and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies, as in a manner having no faſter friends then ſuch as are our friends for their owne advantage: which giveth me occaſion to diſtruſt greatlie this new confirmed league with the French king, which (notwithſtanding I wiſhe it may ſtand alwaies inviolable) yet I greatlie feare by the preſident of former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it will no longer ſtand then the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſee how to help themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves better by newe friendſhip, be it with<note place="margin">This prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cv of that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man is now prooved true.</note> Spaniards or others. And if we account it a great benefite that the Scottiſh king
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20381:107"/> is not our enemie in theſe broken times, is it not to be eſteemed a thouſand times a greater benefite to haue him made as faſt and ſure to vs, as if he were our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie-man or natiue Engliſh-man borne, and one of our ſelves, and that we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and made vp with the acceſſe of his ſtrength and kingdome, by which we ſhall be ſo fenced and fortreſſed on that quarter without our charges, or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our men (as now we are forced to doe) that no port or part of Engl. ſhall be ſurer. Nay, whereas now we are driven to ſeeke the amitie, and in a ſort beg the favour of forrain nations, yea, of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Turkes, and with infinite char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and loſe of our men, to entertaine their friendſhip, beeing once enlarged and ſtrengthened with the forces &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Scotland, wee ſhall not neede to currie favour with Mahomet or Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, or weigh the diſpleaſure or offence of all the Princes in the world. And Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which (now ſtealing furniture and proviſion of munition from thence) doth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20381:108"/> with flaſhing flames of rebellion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our people and emptie our coffers, ſhall then (being not onelie deſtitute of that aide, but having it all emploied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf) be content with leſſer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges then the owne revenewes to bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and to be kept in loyall obedience, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving England on the one ſide, &amp; Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on the other to command it. Thus our treaſures &amp; powers ſhalbe encreaſed, our people ſpared, our ſubſidies eaſed, &amp; our charges abated. Laſtlie the encreaſe of ſubiectes, which ſome eſteeme but as a matter of ſmall or no importance. I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to be the greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity that anie kingdome could ever afford. I haue for my warrat the words of as wiſe &amp; rich a king as ever did raigne, who ſayeth not,<note place="margin">Prov. 14 28.</note> that wealth or riches, but that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſubiectes are the honour of the Prince, and that for the want of ſubiects co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the deſtruction of a Prince. That is, the multitude of ſubiects is the riches, ſtrength, power, protection &amp; ſtay of the kingdome, and it is the cauſe of al things
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20381:108"/> for which any ſtate is honored &amp; renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: &amp; for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubiects any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or ſtate doth decreaſe &amp; decay fró the glory and honour of the forenamed things: for any Politicall ſtate is called in the Scripture a Prince, or King, and all<note place="margin">Dau. 8. 22.</note> theſe things that are accompanied with honor, or that procure the ſame are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo by the name of honor. If therefore the right bee his, let vs ſtand perſwaded though all the world would ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the onlie way to attaine to riches, honor, and all kind of commodities is for conſcience ſake to yeeld to him his right For he that cannot lie hath ſaid, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is great riches, &amp; bringeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of minde: &amp; in obedience to God there is wonderfull gaine. So to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this part of the pretended inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, I ſay, that everie worldlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie hath ſome diſcommodity, &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences may be alleadged againſt the beſt actions and purpoſes that any man coulde ever haue intended or done: but this si a ſound Maxime embraced by all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20381:109"/> men: that, Any inconvenience is rather to be admitted then a manifeſt miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs ſee what he is, or where he is, that may bee thought fitter then the Scottiſh King, to carrie the ſweigh &amp; the burthen of the Realme. An Engliſh-man he muſt bee, for it were too too bad, yea intolerable to defeate the King of his right, and to giue it to a ſtranger. Which therefore of the Engliſh competitors is of that extraordinarie wiſdome, ſpirit, action, favour with the nobilitie &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, power and force, who ſhalbe able with loue or feare to lead &amp; drawe after him all the reſt of the competitors? To mannage our ſtate, yea our troubled ſtate at home, to wage warres with the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh king, &amp; with all the reſt of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad? Or what reſpects hath anie of them all, for whoſe ſake all wee ſhould vndertake ſo hard a matche, as to encoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter with God? It is not my meaning to ſeek the diſgrace, or to lay open the weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of any noble perſonage: but if it be true, that men of good credite (who haue
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20381:109"/> reaſon to know him) doe confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: All our Engliſhe competitors if in all kinde of reſpects they do freelie yeeld to him: yet in my iudgement they ſhall doe themſelves no wrong. And I thinke that many of the ſtate (if not al) be much of my minde, for they think and call the Scottiſh king too deepe, for his ſingular wit &amp; wiſdome as it ſhould ſeeme. As for the hidden reſpects of our Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, what ſhould we talke of them, ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing they came never yet to the tryal: they ſhould much better appeare, if the beſt reſpected of them all, or they all iointlie had his place for a few yeeres to rule the vn-rulie Scots. It were then to be feared, that for want of reſpects, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Scottiſhe prickers would ryde them: yea, I perſwade my ſelf it were by great ods a better choiſe for them to ſeek out this new kingdome of Guiana, or to raigne in Vtopia, then to vndertake the handling of ſuch a heady people, though they had this advantage that they were Scottiſh-men borne. Yet he almoſt from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20381:110"/> his cradle hath kept them in by feare, by authoritie or policie: hee hath revenged the oppreſſed, repreſſed mightily their deadlie feedes, &amp; hath puniſhed moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verelie the mightieſt offenders All this hath hee done with that liking and good loue of his people, that none of his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ever had: and there is ſtrong hope that he will continue to do ſo ſtill. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to leaue the Scottiſh king, if they be compared with themſelves, and (al their reſpects being laide in true ballance) be vprightlie iudged, which of them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſhal go beyond the reſt? will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man think himſelf as fit as any other. And if the matter go not by mens right, but by their reſpects, is there not ſome men in Engl. that wil look to be as much reſpected, yea and a great deale more, then any of them all? Some men may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the Parliament will decide it. And who ſhall call this Parliament? Or at whoſe commandement will the ſtates aſſemble? for after that her Maieſt. breath is out of her bodie (as the Erle of Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20381:110"/> did not ſtick to tell her) her highnes privie councell, then is no more a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. And I wiſh that all the counſellers &amp; all the Nobilitie do not finde themſelves otherwaies buſied at that time, then to be calling of Parliaments. Yet admit that the councel may be moſt willing, that it may be a councel ſtil, and haue both the power and meanes to call the ſaid Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament: what? will we indeed be ſo ſtout as to call in queſtion, and handle that matter then? which as we plainly do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe we are afraide to touche nowe? or will the longeſt ſword &amp; greateſt power giue place and permit it to be a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? Yet I will alſo yeelde that it may bee ſo, though the like were never ſeene nor heard of before. When the Parliament is ſet, will the matter then be preſently cleered? no obiection made? no ſtop, hinderance, inconvenience, or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect alleadged againſt the firſt by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petitors? al without interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil go on peace-ablie? And the Scottiſh king (belike) will bee ſo ſaint-hearted as hee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20381:111"/> dare not to demand his right then, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that by everie of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors almoſt, hee renueth his claime now? Hee nor his friends will make no manner of ſturre in the North, becauſe he is, forſooth, too weake to matche any of the Competitors that bee nowe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that by the skilfull &amp; wiſe iudgement of her Maieſtie in the third yeere of her moſt happy raigne, the com petitors that then were could not in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectof favor or of force be compared to his mother. No man wil preſume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him, till ſuch time as they ſhall heare what will be the reſolution of the Parliament, whither it is given to ſome that he can like of or not. Neither York, Berwick nor Biſhoprick, nor no place els there will receiue him: he muſt therefore keep himſelfe cloſe, becauſe the matter doth not concerne him. All the Welſh gentlemen, as degenerated, will diſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde their kindred, &amp; whollie abandon him. Naturall blindnes or fooliſhnes is to be pitied, but wilfull blindnes and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20381:111"/> is to be condemned. Yet to goe a little further. When the Parliament hath ſaide and reſolved, will they all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede take it for a finall iudgement? Nay I warrant you: All the Competitors that miſſe of the crowne, will bee highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and a great manie more that can pretend no claime: and it is like that all theſe will plainly diſclaime it, and call it vnlawfull, and there will not be wanting ſome, that for privat reſpects wil egge on the competitors to take exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Heere it may be imagined, that the Parliament will carefullie and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie provide for ſuch iſſues: either by taking recogniza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of great ſummes of the parties grieved for the keeping of the publick peace, or pledges for their loialty to the new elected Prince: or in caſe they refuſe theſe things, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to priſon: A iolly rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tale to remedy the matter, if they did forfeat their bonds in what court ſhould they ſue them? for it carrieth no ſenſe, to thinke that they will anſwere in the lower Court, who do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20381:112"/> the higheſt: and take the beſt pledges that they can giue, will they bee more carefull of them, then deſirous of the kingdome? But it might bee, that they would find meanes to ſet them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and if that ſhoulde not fall out ſo, durſt the king elected, in caſe of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, execute the pledges, or when they were executed, were he then anie ſurer? Nay, I dare aſſure you, in a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous caſe: for the execution of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages is never free from hatred &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. The committing of themſelves, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, is the onlie way, if it haue this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, that all their adherents, favourers &amp; friendes bee at once laide vp with them. And who ſhall commit all theſe, and to what priſones? for it is like they will bee much about two parts of England. The Lord graunt wee deceiue not our ſelves with our owne conceits: for our comfort or helpe that we may looke for, to come from other nations, it will be iuſt none at all. Rebellion in Ireland, all in armes in Scotland, God knoweth what in Wales.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20381:112"/> And if anie realm ſhould aide vs, al their aide muſt be this, that by their helpe wee are furthered to roote out ourſelves: warres ſhal devoure everie-where, &amp; our ſafetie ſhall be no-where. The Proteſtant ſhall yarne for the bloode of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant &amp; the papiſt &amp; athieſt for the blood of them both: no regarde ſhall be had of profeſſion, ſexe or age. And, which of al miſeries is moſt dolefull and lamentable, wee can no ſooner expect an end of this tragedie, then our realme, or rather both realmes be vtterly exſtirped and brought to an end. For the Scottiſheking can not in anie reaſon, thinke himſelfe or his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſure, ſo long as their profeſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie or anie of his poſterity ſhall raign kings in England, ſeeing he that taketh a mans living, will alſo ſeek to take his life, if he may come by it. And on the other part, the king of England muſt think that he ſtandeth moſt ticklous and ſlippery, ſo long as either the Scottiſhe king, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, complices, or anie other of the competitors doe liue, according to the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20381:113"/> ſpeeche of the Poet, <hi>Nulla fides regni ſocijs.</hi> Then we which cannot nowe be content with the ordinance of God, ſhall ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our willes the luſtes and pleaſures of men: for beeing enemies to our ſelves &amp; to God, how can we thinke that others will be our friends? Then for our propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sabothes we ſhall haue Sabothes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and a number of vs, who are not moved with this queſtion now, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps then for the ſame, and, it may bee in the maintenance of the wrongfull quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell be brought, not to reſt &amp; lay downe our bodies in honorable peace in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors graue, but to be buried in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the beaſts, or in the mawes of the fowles of the aire. I am grieved to thinke or to talke of this lamentable ſubiect, it may pleaſe God that I ſhal not liue to ſee it debated. Therefore to ſurceaſe more<note place="margin">So it pleaſed God to call him to his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the time of his impriſonment in the Tower, where he was committed</note> writing of that which both mine eares do tinckle to heare: I will giue you that counſell and adviſe, which I could wiſhe (if it pleaſed God) all England did take, to witte. That ſeeing they who are bound

For I would bee loath that this my opinion ſhould be a ground for you, or for others to reſt vppon: Wiſe men will build their actions vpon knowledge, &amp; not do as beaſtes doe, goe, whither they are led. A foole (ſaieth Salomon doeth beleeue every thing, but the wiſe wil con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider his ſteps, and will worke by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. It is the wiſdome of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to vnderſtand his way: but the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes of fooles is to be deceived. Good
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20381:114"/> Sit, if you doe ſee or diſcerne more then I, bee willing for conſcience to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it with friendes, for all doe ſtand bound to yeelde to better reaſon. And they that haue any means of knowledge vouchſafed them from God, ought to vſe them to the beſt benefite and inſtruction of others, &amp; this they ought to do while they breath in this life: for there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conference, nor adviſe, nor counſell in the graue, whither wee muſt goe. By theſe meanes having the bleſſing &amp; dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God we ſhall notſtand amazed, and as out of our wits in the day of triall, but by certainty of knowledge &amp; perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good conſcience ſhall cleaue &amp; ioine our ſelves to the beſt right. A man halfe warned, is whollie armed: but the armour of a good conſcience is like to a braſen wall. Having thus both attained to this knowledge yourſelf, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake holpen others to the ſame, the ſecond, third, fourth, fift, &amp; all the reſt of the parts of mine adviſe are, that ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and with a good &amp; honeſt heart you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20381:114"/> follow the knowne trueth, without any reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of country, or kindred: for he whom we are to preferre before our children &amp; wiues, hath aſſured vs that the vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the vpright ſhall guide his way, &amp; that the wicked ſhall bee taken in his owne wickedneſſe: That a man ſhall not be eſtabliſhed by wickedneſſe, and that the roote of the righteous ſhal not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved. So to conclude mine opinion &amp; to make an end of this Treatiſe, I had rather chooſe to die in defence of the good right, then once wiſhe to liue to maintaine a bad quarrell. The Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wiſe, mercifull, and gracious cleare our vnderſtandings &amp; minds in this caſe, and ſtrengthen and direct all our hearts, that wee in obedience to him, may giue the crowne and Realme with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and peace to that man, to whome he hath beene pleaſed to giue the right.</p>
